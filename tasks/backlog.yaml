  Backlog items derived from recent literature analysis. Each entry maps a
  documented research gap to a concrete follow-up action that can be handled
  by deterministic adapters or shared prompt packs.

backlog:
  - id: backlog.exante_lcsa_scenarios
    summary: "Deterministic templates for ex-ante life cycle sustainability scenarios."
    rationale: >
      The systematic review on future scenarios in LCA highlights missing,
      reusable blueprints for ex-ante assessments. Automating scenario template
      generation would help codify best practices and reduce reliance on ad-hoc
      prompts.
    action_items:
      - Build a scenario template adapter that accepts sector, geography, and time-horizon inputs and emits structured LCSA scenario stubs (JSON/YAML).
      - Package companion prompts under specs/prompts/ to support hybrid workflows when LLM-based synthesis is required.

  - id: backlog.heritage_restoration_indicators
    summary: "Indicator catalog for cultural heritage restoration sustainability assessments."
    rationale: >
      Current studies note the lack of comparable, multi-dimensional indicators
      when evaluating heritage restoration projects. Encoding a deterministic
      indicator catalog would enable reproducible scoring outside of bespoke case studies.
    action_items:
      - Assemble indicator metadata (environmental, social, economic) into a reusable registry (YAML/Parquet) with traceable sources.
      - Expose a service method that cross-walks indicators with SDG/GHG ontologies for CLI reporting.
    dependencies:
      - ontology.sdgfetch
      - ontology.ghgparse

  - id: backlog.gold_mining_lcsa_dataset
    summary: "Curated corpus and prompt pack for LCSA in the gold mining sector."
    rationale: >
      The LCSA gold mining review calls out under-documented social and environmental impact pathways. A focused corpus and prompt pack can bootstrap replication studies.
    action_items:
      - Use collect_mcp_corpus.py to seed an initial dataset, then normalise key variables (region, mining process, impact category) into tabular form.
      - Publish a matching prompt template (EN/ZH) that orchestrates deterministic lookups before any synthesis.
