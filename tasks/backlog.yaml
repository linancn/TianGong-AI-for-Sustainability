description: >
  Backlog items derived from recent workflow reviews. Each entry maps an
  identified automation gap to concrete follow-up actions that can be handled
  by deterministic adapters, services, or shared prompt packs.

backlog:
  - id: backlog.workflow_simple_batch_support
    summary: "Extend workflow.simple to support batch execution across multiple prompts."
    rationale: >
      Operators frequently need to run the simple workflow for several regions
      or scenarios in one invocation. Batch-mode orchestration keeps runs
      deterministic and avoids ad-hoc shell scripting.
    action_items:
      - Add CLI flags (`--batch-config`, `--batch-variable`) to load structured execution matrices.
      - Update workflow.simple services to iterate deterministically with per-run caching and consolidated reporting.
    dependencies:
      - workflow.simple
      - cli.command.visuals_verify
    tags: ["workflow", "automation", "batch"]
    status: proposed

  - id: backlog.workflow_visuals_resilience
    summary: "Harden visualization steps inside workflow.simple and downstream orchestrations."
    rationale: >
      AntV MCP outages should not block sustainability assessments. A resilience
      layer ensures workflows degrade gracefully and surface remediation steps.
    action_items:
      - Detect chart-server availability ahead of visualization sub-steps and emit actionable guidance when unreachable.
      - Provide Markdown/CSV fallbacks for chart data so reports stay reproducible without MCP output.
    dependencies:
      - workflow.simple
      - tools.chart_mcp_server
    tags: ["workflow", "visuals", "resilience"]
    status: proposed

  - id: backlog.workflow_deep_research_template_evaluation
    summary: "Create deterministic evaluation harness for workflow.template.deep_research."
    rationale: >
      The deep research template blends deterministic retrieval with synthesis.
      An evaluation harness verifies evidence coverage and prompt-template
      adherence as the pipeline evolves across domains.
    action_items:
      - Record canonical fixture inputs/outputs and build pytest regressions with mocked adapters.
      - Add observability tags and structured metrics for evidence provenance and token usage.
    dependencies:
      - workflow.template.deep_research
    tags: ["workflow", "evaluation", "testing"]
